## Core Features:

- Project Showcase: Detailed display of development projects with descriptions, images, and links to live demos or repositories.

- Experience Timeline: Interactive timeline presenting educational background and work experience.
- Contact Form: Easy-to-use contact form for inquiries and opportunities.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark scheme (#121212) to provide a professional, modern feel.
- Primary color: Light yellow (#FFDA63). This is slightly brighter than the original rgba(240, 166, 7, 0.933), so that it is effective in a dark scheme. The slightly desaturated yellow can evoke coding references like command-line interfaces, code syntax highlighting, and developer communities, for a tech-forward but not generic vibe.
- Accent color: Pale blue (#73B9FF) to provide contrast to the primary color.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Minimalist icons to represent skills, projects, and sections. Icons will follow a line art style for clarity and simplicity.
- Clean, responsive layout with clear sections for easy navigation. Utilize grid and flexbox for structure.
- Subtle transitions and animations on hover and scroll to enhance user experience.
